# NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)
========

An implementation of the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).

## What it’s all about?
From the respective [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA-TLX):
> The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) is a subjective, multidimensional assessment tool that rates perceived workload, in order to assess a task, system, or team’s effectiveness or other aspects of performance. It was developed by the Human Performance Group at NASA’s [Ames Research Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_Research_Center) over a three year development cycle that included more than 40 laboratory simulations. It has been cited in over 550 studies and a recent search for “NASA-TLX” on Google Scholar revealed over 3,660 articles. These statistics highlight the large influence the NASA-TLX has had in [Human Factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Factors) research.

Learn more about it at the official [NASA-TLX website](http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/groups/TLX/). You can also take a look at the original paper [<cite>Development of NASA-TLX (Task Load Index): Results of Empirical and Theoretical Research</cite>](http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/groups/TLX/downloads/NASA-TLXChapter.pdf) (PDF format, 1.4 MB).
